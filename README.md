# Project Title
* Front End Test Inputs HTML/JS
## Description
* Front end test using javascript functions to display the average and median of 3 html inputs.
* Started with !DOCTYPE html for live server to work.
* Used VSCode Live Server for continuous viewing while working on project.
* Created results function that starts with setting each different input ID and sets it to a values a, b, c.
* Created 2 more functions that displays average and median for newly set values.
* Also added .toFixed(2) to averageResult so that the max numbers after decimal point will be 2.
* getElementById for h2 lines that each displays innerHTML with text and each of the 2 results function on submit.
* Created forms and inputs inside of div. "math-form" is where onsubmit is so html 'required' validation works correctly.
* HTML setup on each input should prevent user from entering and arrowing to a negative number.
* Added internal CSS styling to see final results better.
## Getting Started
* Just an index.html file with everything on it. Also deployed on GitHub Pages for easier access.
### Dependencies
* A Computer or device with a browser.
